right now it is playable strategy game mostly for showing what is being done than a good storyline
the more it is played the more bugs and failures will be notices since it is extremely hard to make games like these and think about 10000 aspects of every element
if you notice a bug or fatal error please let me know for future updates and improvements

#i am open to partnering to develop this game further and publish it on a platform

note : i did not know finding assets for a game would be this impossible
